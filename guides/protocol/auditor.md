# Auditor

The **Auditor** is the risk management layer of the protocol; it determines how much collateral a user is required to maintain, and whether (and by how much) a user can be liquidated. Each time a user borrows from a [Market](market/), the **Auditor** validates his accountâ€™s liquidity to determine his health factor.

## Public State Variables

```solidity
function BASE_FEED() external view returns (address)
```

Address that a market should have as price feed to consider as base price and avoid external price call.

### liquidationIncentive

```solidity
