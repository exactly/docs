# PriceFeedDouble

Returns the price of an asset considering two different [Chainlink](https://docs.chain.link/docs/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses/) price feeds.

Written as a generic implementation it can be used, for example, to retrieve the price of `WBTC`. Queries `BTC/ ETH` feed and multiplies it by the exchange rate between `WBTC / BTC` before returning the price that itâ€™s then used by the [Auditor](auditor.md).
