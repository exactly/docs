# ðŸ›° Periphery

This section contains valuable resources that are not part of the protocol's core and could be helpful for developers seeking to integrate Exactly into other applications.

These smart contracts function as peripherals, seamlessly integrating with the Protocol contracts and acting as indispensable "helpers." While they undergo continuous development and refinement, it's essential to note that they have not yet undergone a formal audit due to their auxiliary nature.
