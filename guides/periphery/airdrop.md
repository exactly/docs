# ðŸª‚ Airdrop

Using Solmate's Merkle tree library, this smart contract can validate the eligibility of an address for the airdrop and the appropriate amount based on a set of predetermined criteria.

It interfaces with the [Sablier protocol](https://sablier.com), a token streaming mechanism, to facilitate the creation of an NFT for each recipient and subsequently initiate the airdrop stream.
