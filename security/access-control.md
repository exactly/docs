# ðŸ”‘ Access Control

## Roles & Privileges

There are a few roles to be aware of in the system. Each role has a set of privileges that are associated with it.

### Admin - Timelock Controller

The `TimelockController` smart contract acts as the `administrator` role in the protocol. It implements a governance mechanism called a timelock, which delays the execution of transactions to allow for evaluation of their potential impact before proceeding. The contract has two distinct roles: the `proposer`, who submits transactions, and the `executor`, who executes them after the timelock period expires. The number of signatures required for a transaction to be executed is defined in the multisig contract, providing a secure and transparent method of controlling execution. The timelock period is currently set at 12 hours, enabling quick and flexible decision making by the protocol's administrators.

More info about this in the [governance section](../getting-started/white-paper.md#4.Governance).

### Pauser

The pauser role is responsible for temporarily suspending certain operations in emergency situations. The pausable operations are `deposit`, `borrow`, `repay` and `liquidate`. These operations may be paused by the protocol's administrators to protect the system and its users in case of an emergency. However, the `withdraw` function will always remain active, allowing users to access and withdraw their funds at any time. This role is held by the protocol's administrators, who use it to protect the system and its users in case of an emergency.

## Upgradeable Contracts

The following contracts are upgradeable and can be changed by the `TimelockController`:
