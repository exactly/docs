# üêõ Bug Bounty Program

Exactly Protocol partnered with Immunefi to offer a Bug Bounty Program to incentivize security researchers to find vulnerabilities in our protocol, rewarding individuals who can identify and report security flaws.

Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2/). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.

You can access the program at the following link: [**https://immunefi.com/bounty/exactly/**](https://immunefi.com/bounty/exactly/).
