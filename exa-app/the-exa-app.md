# The Exa App

At Exactly Protocol, our mission has always been clear: innovate and make DeFi more accessible to real-world users. With the success of our fixed-rate DeFi credit market, we set a new standard for stability and predictability in crypto lending and borrowing.\


Now, we're advancing with the launch of the Exa App and its first product, the Exa Card, the first onchain credit card. Available from day one in 160+ countries, it offers seamless global access without requiring a bank account or credit score. \

Exa App account creation is powered by passkeys, which replace traditional passwords and recovery phrases with a secure, biometric-based method, such as fingerprint or facial recognition. During setup, the app generates a passkey linked to your device, secured by your biometric data, which remains stored locally. This ensures both privacy and security at all times.

The next step is to complete the KYC process, after which your Exa Card will be issued.&#x20;
