#### API integration

100% whitelabel solution, giving the partner complete control to build our services directly into their own platform. This path is ideal for partners who want a seamless, deeply integrated experience that matches their existing brand precisely.

* Total Control: The partner selects exactly which Exa services to implement.
* Complete Customization:  Full control over the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI).
* Whitelabel Branding: Design the entire flow to match partner's brand, including the option to create a custom design for the Exa Card.

#### Web-Based Integration

This is the fastest way to get started. In just a few days, the partner can embed the Exa "mini-app" directly into their platform.

This solution provides users with a complete set of financial services without requiring them to leave the partner's app or website.

* Fast to Market: Go live in just a few days with minimal development effort.
* Full Functionality:  Access to the complete, pre-built Exa experience.
* Seamless Access: Users can access all services from within the partner's platform.
