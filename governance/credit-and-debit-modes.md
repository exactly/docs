# Credit and Debit Modes

When you set the Exa Card to Credit mode, you can buy now, pay later, and hold your crypto. Your deposited assets act as collateral, and the app calculates a credit limit based on them. Then, within the app, you can choose the number of installments for repayment, from one to six fixed-rate payments.

Each time you make a purchase, the Exa App takes a USDC loan through Exactly Protocol, which is then converted to USD for the seller. Repayments start up to four weeks later, with installments due every 28 days. On the Card screen, you'll see a payment calendar that tracks your repayments.

In debit mode, you can use your card just like any other debit card. Payments are debited directly from your USDC balance.
