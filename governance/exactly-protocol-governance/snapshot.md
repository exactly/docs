# âš¡ Snapshot

[Snapshot ](https://snapshot.org/#/)is a simple voting interface that allows users to signal sentiment off-chain. Votes on Snapshot are weighted by the number of EXA owned by an address.

Our Snapshot voting platform can be found [here](https://gov.exact.ly/#/), where all EXAIPs are housed.

Please be aware that to be an eligible voter for any proposal on our Snapshot you must have EXA from any or all of the above options at the time of the vote being started. This means that you cannot simply buy EXA tokens to vote on an already ongoing vote, and is meant to reduce the risk of influence by whales and flashloaners.
