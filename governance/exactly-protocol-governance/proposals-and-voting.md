# ‚úç Proposals and Voting

EXA is the governance token of Exactly Protocol that will be used as our voting metric and is decided as follows:

* EXAIPs are subject to a simple majority vote. To maintain the platform's integrity, submitting a proposal requires a minimum score of 100 EXA tokens, ensuring genuine contributions and preventing spam.&#x20;
* The voting delay will be 1 day, the voting period will be 5 days, and for approval, a proposal must meet a threshold of 100,000 EXA tokens (1% of the total EXA supply).&#x20;
* A new governance proposal can change these initial parameters.
* esEXA tokens carry the same voting power as regular EXA tokens. This parity in voting rights ensures fairness and equal participation in the governance process.
